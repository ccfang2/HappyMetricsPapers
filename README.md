<details><summary>Reading Group, BGSE</summary>
<p>

> This reading group is an informal event organized by professors and PhD students at BGSE, and focuses on theoretical Econometrics. It is led by [Prof. Freyberger](https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/en/department/team/professors/joachim-freyberger) and runs every week during semester.
